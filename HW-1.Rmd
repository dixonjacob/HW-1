## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Alison Cook
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW: 7 hours or so
* What gave you the most trouble: Dumb little technical things; forgetting to remove an extra piping symbol at the end of a function, capitalization, etc. 
* Any comments you have: I was a little confused by some of the questions and had to spend too much time doing things that reall shouldn't. Not really anything you can do about that though...





## Question 1:

* Plot a "time series" of the proportion of flights that were delayed by > 30 minutes on each day.  i.e.
    + the x-axis should be some notion of time
    + the y-axis should be the proportion.
* Which seasons did we tend to see the most and least delays of > 30 minutes.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

#Determine the number of flights per day
per_day <- flights %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(num_of_flights = n)

#Determine the number of flights delayed per day
delayed <- flights %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  filter(dep_delay > 30) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(num_delayed = n)

#Merge the two and then calculate the proportion delayed per day
joined_delay_and_date <- left_join(per_day,delayed, by = "date") %>% 
  mutate(prop = round(num_delayed/num_of_flights,3))

#Graph dat stuff. 
ggplot(data=joined_delay_and_date, aes(x = date, y = prop))+
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Will My Flight Be Delayed by 30 Minutes or More?", x = "Date", y = "Proportion of Delayed Flights")

#other idea: add color for seasons? Hmm...

```



## Question 2:

Some people prefer flying on older planes.  Even though they aren't as nice,
they tend to have more room.  Which airlines should these people favor?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

#Join by the planes and group by the carrier
planes_joinedto_flights <- left_join(flights, planes, by = "plane") %>% 
  group_by(carrier)

#Plot the carrier versus the year the plane was made 
ggplot(data=planes_joinedto_flights, aes(x = carrier, y = year))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "How do I find an old plane?", x = "Airline Carrier", y = "Year the aircraft was built")

  

```







## Question 3:

* What states did listed Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?
* What states did all Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

#First, where did the listed flights go to:
airports_joinedto_flights <- left_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "iata")) %>% 
  filter(carrier =="WN") %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  distinct(flight) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(unique_flights_per_state  = n)
  
airports_joinedto_flights
 
ggplot(data = airports_joinedto_flights, aes(x = state, y = unique_flights_per_state)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Where does Southwest fly?", x = "Destination State", y = "Number of Flights")




#Join by the airport code and filter out only Southwest (WN) flights
airports_joinedto_flights <- left_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "iata")) %>% 
  filter(carrier=="WN") %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(flights_per_state = n)

airports_joinedto_flights

ggplot(data = airports_joinedto_flights, aes(x = state, y = flights_per_state)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Where does Southwest really fly?", x = "Destination State", y = "Number of Flights")



```





## Question 4:

What weather patterns are associated with the biggest departure delays?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

#Join the flights with weather info 
flights_with_weather <- left_join(flights, weather, by = c("date", "hour") ) %>% 
  group_by(conditions)

ggplot(data = flights_with_weather, aes(x = conditions, y = dep_delay)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = abbreviate) +
  labs(title = "Weather Conditions and Departure Delays", x = "Weather Condition Abbreviation", y = "Delay Length")


#This looks jumbled and tough to read, but it is the right idea. 


#I want to make bins with delays of various ranges, but I don't know how to make that kind of statement
#it would probably need some ifelses 

# delay_frequencies <- flights_with_weather %>% 
#   group_by(dep_delay) %>% 
#   tally() %>% 
#   #something creating bins
#   rename(delay_range = n)


```





## Question 5:

I want to know what proportionately regions (NE, south, west, midwest) each 
carrier flies to from Houston in the month of July.  Consider the `month()`
function from the `lubridate` package.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

#Do some joining to get us started
airports_to_flights_first <- left_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "iata"))

#Complete the join so we can have all the info we want
airports_to_flights_to_states <- left_join(airports_to_flights_first, states, by = "state") %>% 
  mutate(month(date))

#Filter out July
airports_to_flights_to_states %>% 
  filter(month(date) == 7) %>% 
  tally()

#This gives 20,548
#Now to figure out how many in each region

flights_per_region <- airports_to_flights_to_states %>% 
  filter(month(date) == 7) %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(number_of_flights = n)

#Now to do a quick calculation and add a column for the proportion

flights_per_region <- flights_per_region %>% 
  mutate(proportion = round(number_of_flights/20548,3))

#Make this a bar plot! 

ggplot(data = flights_per_region, aes(x = region, y = proportion)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Flights in July", x = "Region", y = "Proportion")


# #I think this would work, but I don't know how to get it to work 
# flights_in_july <- airports_to_flights_to_states %>% 
#   group_by(region) %>%
#   filter(month(date)) %>% 
#   #somehow select for just july
#   tally() %>%
#   #divide by the total for all regions to get proportion
#   rename(flights_per_region = n)


```
